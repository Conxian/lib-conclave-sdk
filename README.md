The core Rust SDK for Conclave, providing cross-platform hardware enclave abstractions for Android StrongBox, Apple Secure Enclave, and Cloud TEE environments.

## Purpose

Provide cross-platform hardware enclave abstractions and utilities for key custody, attestation, and signing across Android StrongBox, Apple Secure Enclave, and Cloud TEE environments.

## Status

- **Status**: Beta / Active Development (`0.x`)
- **0.x policy**: Breaking changes may land in any release.
- **1.0+ policy**: After `1.0.0`, we follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Breaking changes only land in major releases.

## Ownership

Ownership and review requirements are defined in [`CODEOWNERS`](./CODEOWNERS).

## Repository

- **Category**: Security Infrastructure SDK
- **Support**: Managed by Conxian-Labs (See [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for details)

## Audience

- Wallet and mobile engineers integrating hardware-backed key custody.
- Security and cryptography engineers reviewing attestation and signing flows.
- Platform integrators building enclave-backed identity and authorization.

## Relationship to the Conxian stack

- A core security primitive consumed by [Conxius Wallet](https://github.com/Conxian/conxius-wallet) (via the Rust crate and/or WebAssembly (WASM) bindings) for hardware-backed key custody and signing.
- Complements [Conxian Gateway](https://github.com/Conxian/conxian-gateway) by providing hardware-attested signatures and client-side trust guarantees for protocol flows.

## Features

- **Hardware-Backed Security**: Interfaces with secure hardware (StrongBox/TEE) for key generation and signing.
- **Hardware Attestation**: Cryptographic proof of device integrity (StrongBox/TEE/Cloud TEE) mandatory for high-value rail operations.
- **Sovereign Handshake**: Non-custodial signing protocol ensuring "Zero Secret Egress" for all cross-chain swaps.
- **Business Management**: Lifecycle and cryptographic identity for partners and affiliates with secure attribution.
- **Asset Registry**: Structured registry and validation for cross-chain assets (BTC, ETH, STX, USDT, etc.).
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Native support for ECDSA (EVM, Bitcoin, Stacks) and Schnorr (Taproot, RGB, BitVM).
- **Superior Taproot Support**: Native BIP341 tweak calculation and signing within the secure enclave.
- **MuSig2 Orchestration**: Simplified API for M-of-N multi-signature protocols.
- **Stacks Support**: Specialized handlers for Stacks message signing and transaction payload formatting.
- **WebAssembly Bindings**: Fully compatible with WASM for browser-based secure key management.

## Architecture

The SDK is organized into three main layers:

1. **Enclave Layer** (`src/enclave`): Abstracted hardware interfaces (`EnclaveManager`). Includes `CoreEnclaveManager` (Headless/Android) and `CloudEnclave`.
2. **Protocol Layer** (`src/protocol`): Multi-chain and multi-sig logic, Business Management, Asset Registry, and Sovereign Rails.
3. **Binding Layer** (`src/wasm_bindings.rs`): Clean JavaScript/TypeScript interfaces for high-level integration.

## Usage (WASM)

```typescript
import { ConclaveWasmClient } from 'lib-conclave-sdk';

// Initialize client with Gateway URL and optional KMS endpoint
const client = new ConclaveWasmClient("https://api.conxian.io", "https://vault.conxian.io");

// Unlock the enclave with user PIN and salt
await client.unlock_enclave("my_secure_pin", "salt_hex_value");

// Register a partner locally
client.register_business("partner_01", "Partner Name", "0x...");

// Execute a swap with full Sovereign Handshake
// Intent objects are prepared and signed within the SDK
const response = await client.execute_swap(
    intent,
    signature,
    attestation
);
```

## Development

Requires Rust 1.94+ (Edition 2024).

```bash
# Build core Rust SDK
cargo build

# Run unit tests
cargo test

# Build WASM bindings (requires wasm-pack)
wasm-pack build
```

## Verification

Core components are covered by automated unit tests. Run `cargo test` to execute the test suite locally.
