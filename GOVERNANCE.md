# Governance — lib-conclave-sdk

This document defines the business role, ownership, and operational standards for the Conclave SDK.

## 1. Business Role

The Conclave SDK (`lib-conclave-sdk`) is the **canonical high-integrity integration surface** for hardware-backed operations in the Conxian ecosystem.

### Architectural Boundaries
To maintain a clear separation of concerns:
- **`lib-conclave-sdk` (This Repo)**: Dedicated to secure enclave abstractions, hardware attestation integration, and cryptographic signing orchestration. It is the "Enforcer" of Zero Secret Egress.
- **`lib-conxian-core`**: Dedicated to shared protocol primitives, data schemas, and non-enclave-specific logic.

Its primary role is to provide a unified, secure interface for:

- **Institutional Key Custody**: Hardware-backed key management and signing.
- **Sovereign Interoperability**: Orchestration of non-custodial cross-chain swaps via the Sovereign Handshake.
- **Identity & Attribution**: Cryptographic partner identification and business attribution.
- **Financial Messaging**: ISO 20022 and Conxian Job Card Schema (CJCS) generation.

As a shared public-facing dependency, the SDK ensures that all downstream products (like Conxius Wallet) and external integrations adhere to the core security principles of **Zero Secret Egress** and **Hardware Attestation**.

## 2. Ownership & Support

- **Primary Owner**: [Conxian](https://github.com/Conxian)
- **Support Channel**:
  - Technical issues and feature requests should be tracked via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Conxian/lib-conclave-sdk/issues).
  - Security vulnerabilities MUST be reported to `security@conxian.com` as per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Service Level**: The SDK is currently in **Beta** (`0.x`). Support is provided on a best-effort basis by the core engineering team.

## 3. Release Governance

### Versioning Discipline
We strictly follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

- **Major (`X.Y.Z` → `(X+1).0.0`)**: Breaking changes to the core API (e.g., `EnclaveManager` trait modifications).
- **Minor (`X.Y.Z` → `X.(Y+1).0`)**: Backward-compatible new features or significant additions (e.g., new Sovereign Rails).
- **Patch (`X.Y.Z` → `X.Y.(Z+1)`)**: Backward-compatible bug fixes, performance improvements, documentation updates, and technical debt (e.g., hygiene updates).

**Note on 0.x.y versions**: During the Beta phase (`0.x.y`), this is an intentional exception to the usual backward-compatible minor rule: breaking changes may occur in minor releases (e.g., `0.2.3` → `0.3.0`), while patch releases remain backward-compatible (e.g., `0.2.3` → `0.2.4`).

### Compatibility Communication
- **Changelogs**: Every release must include an update to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.
- **Breaking Changes**: For versions >= 1.0.0, breaking changes MUST be introduced only in major releases; APIs SHOULD be deprecated in a minor release (with warnings and release notes) and removed no earlier than the next major release.

## 4. Integration Surface

The SDK exposes two primary integration surfaces:

1. **Rust Crate**: For low-level system integrations and other Rust-based services.
2. **WebAssembly (WASM)**: High-level bindings for browser and mobile environments (e.g., React Native via JSI or WebView).

All public APIs are documented in [README.md](README.md) and through inline Rust documentation (`cargo doc`).

## 5. Prioritized Build/Repair List (Mainnet Readiness)

The following items are prioritized for the SDK's progression toward mainnet readiness (v1.0.0):

1. **Security Hardening (CON-210)**: Implementation of dependency integrity checks and review of unsafe defaults.
2. **Public Readiness Audit (CON-264)**: Final validation of license, security guidance, and contribution workflows.
3. **Release Hygiene (CON-214)**: Establishment of automated release tagging and structured changelog verification.
4. **Secret and Artifact Cleanup (CON-215)**: Continuous monitoring for accidental secret exposure or vendored dependency creep.
5. **Mainnet Readiness Gate (CON-171)**: Final check of canonical repo name and ownership across all Conxian infrastructure.

## 6. Repository Hygiene & Anti-Drift

To prevent degradation of security and operational standards, the following controls are enforced:

- **Automated Hygiene Checks**: CI-integrated checks for forbidden files (e.g., `.env`), sensitive extensions (e.g., `.pem`), and testnet principal contamination.
- **Dependency Integrity**: Regular `cargo audit` and `deny.toml` enforcement to mitigate supply-chain risks.
- **Audit Cadence**: A manual hygiene audit is performed at the end of every major release cycle.
- **Exception Register**: Any deviation from the standard hygiene rules must be documented in `docs/REMEDIATION.md` with an explicit rationale and expiration date.
