# Remediation Report: SDK Core Architecture Alignment

The SDK has been successfully refactored and aligned with the `sdk-core-architecture` proposal.

## 1. Business Management
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**: `BusinessManager` handles identity generation (`generate_business_identity`) and cryptographic attribution (`generate_attribution`). `BusinessRegistry` tracks partner profiles.
- **Verification**: Cryptographic signature verification is now enforced in `RailProxy` using `secp256k1`.

## 2. Asset Registry
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**: `AssetRegistry` manages cross-chain asset metadata and validation. Supports dynamic registration via `register_asset`. Defaults include BTC, ETH, STX, and USDT.

## 3. Modular Architecture
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**:
    - `EnclaveManager` trait formalizes hardware abstraction.
    - `CloudEnclave` implemented for cloud-hosted security.
    - `SovereignRail` implementations (Changelly, Bisq, Wormhole, Boltz, NTT) modularized into `src/protocol/rails/`.
    - `RailProxy` updated to consume `AssetRegistry` and `BusinessRegistry`.

## 4. Sovereign Handshake
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**: Handshake enforces hardware attestation and business attribution verification in `RailProxy`. Wasm bindings provide `execute_swap` as a high-level orchestration helper.

## 5. Mainnet Readiness (CON-145)
- **Governance**: `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` added.
- **Robustness**: Eliminated unsafe panics in `job_card.rs`.
- **Security**: Telemetry and attestation verified across core rails.

## 6. Zero Secret Egress (Remediation)
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**: Fixed a critical security vulnerability in `src/enclave/android_strongbox.rs` where `generate_key` was returning raw secret seeds. The implementation now derives the public key, zeroizes the seed, and returns only the public hex.
- **Verification**: Verified with `cargo test`.

## 7. Oracle Fail-Closed Logic (CON-496)
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**:
    - `contracts/oracle/oracle-aggregator.clar` implemented with quorum-based aggregation, stale price rejection, and emergency override.
    - `contracts/oracle/dimensional-oracle.clar` implemented with fail-closed confidence and staleness checks.
- **Verification**: Verified via manual inspection of Clarity logic.
