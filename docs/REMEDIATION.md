# Remediation Report: SDK Core Architecture Alignment

The SDK has been successfully refactored and aligned with the `sdk-core-architecture` proposal and v1.9.2 standards.

## 1. Business Management
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**: `BusinessManager` handles identity generation (`generate_business_identity`) and cryptographic attribution (`generate_attribution`). `BusinessRegistry` tracks partner profiles.
- **Verification**: Cryptographic signature verification is now enforced in `RailProxy` using `secp256k1`.

## 2. Asset Registry
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**: `AssetRegistry` manages cross-chain asset metadata and validation. Supports dynamic registration via `register_asset`. Defaults include BTC, ETH, STX, USDT, SOL, USDC, LIQUID, and LIGHTNING.

## 3. Modular Architecture
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**:
    - `EnclaveManager` trait formalizes hardware abstraction.
    - `CloudEnclave` implemented for cloud-hosted security.
    - `SovereignRail` implementations (Changelly, Bisq, Wormhole, Boltz, NTT) modularized into `src/protocol/rails/`.
    - `RailProxy` updated to consume `AssetRegistry` and `BusinessRegistry`.

## 4. Sovereign Handshake
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**: Handshake enforces hardware attestation and business attribution verification in `RailProxy`. Wasm bindings provide `execute_swap` as a high-level orchestration helper.

## 5. Mainnet Readiness (CON-145)
- **Governance**: `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `GOVERNANCE.md` added.
- **Robustness**: Eliminated unsafe panics across all core modules.
- **Security**: Telemetry and attestation verified across core rails. Remediated RUSTSEC-2025-0055 by locking `sha2` to `0.10.9`.

## 6. Zero Secret Egress (Remediation)
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**: Fixed a critical security vulnerability in `src/enclave/android_strongbox.rs` where `generate_key` was returning raw secret seeds. The implementation now derives the public key, zeroizes the seed, and returns only the public hex.
- **Verification**: Verified with `cargo test`.

## 7. Oracle Fail-Closed Logic (CON-496)
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**:
    - `contracts/oracle/oracle-aggregator.clar` implemented with quorum-based aggregation, stale price rejection, and emergency override.
    - `contracts/oracle/dimensional-oracle.clar` implemented with fail-closed confidence and staleness checks.
- **Verification**: Verified via manual inspection of Clarity logic.

## 8. Risk Management & Health Factor (CON-499)
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**: `contracts/core/risk-manager.clar` defines canonical LTV thresholds and health-factor calculations for fail-closed solvency enforcement.

## 9. RBAC & Admin Facade (CON-498)
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**: `contracts/core/admin-facade.clar` replaces tautological checks with explicit role-based access control (RBAC).

## 10. Circuit Breaker & Emergency Control (CON-500)
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**: `contracts/core/emergency-control.clar` provides a centralized pause mechanism to block sensitive operations during market volatility or incidents.

## 11. Lending Solvency Checks (CON-497)
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**: `contracts/lending/lending-manager.clar` integrates with `risk-manager.clar` to enforce health-factor checks on borrow and withdraw flows.

## 12. Fail-Closed Integration (Final Phase)
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**:
    - Fully enabled cross-contract calls between `lending-manager.clar`, `emergency-control.clar`, and `risk-manager.clar`.
    - `oracle-aggregator.clar` now includes explicit quorum counting (`AssetQuorumCount`) and resets on update to ensure each epoch meets the required validator threshold.
- **Verification**: Verified via manual inspection and local unit tests for the Rust SDK layer.

## 13. Shared Services (v1.9.2 Alignment)
- **Personal Identity (PSI)**: `IdentityManager` implemented for hardware-backed DIDs.
- **ZKML**: `ZkmlService` for privacy-preserving compliance proofs.
- **DLC**: `DlcManager` for non-custodial financial agreements.
- **SIDL**: `SidlService` for decentralized identity layer governance.

## 14. Pilot Readiness Framework (CON-462)
- **Status**: COMPLETED.
- **Implementation**:
    - Created canonical documentation for Three-Lane Runtime Architecture and Enterprise Custody Baseline.
    - Established SAB Migration Readiness Gates and Deployment Verification Matrix.
    - Implemented functional DlcManager in `src/protocol/dlc.rs` for hardware-backed financial agreements.
- **Verification**: Verified with `cargo test` (31 tests passing).
